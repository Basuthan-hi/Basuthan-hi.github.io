            An epithelium may consist of only one layer of cells when it is called a <b>Unilayered</b> or <b>simple</b> epithelium.Alternatively, it may be <b>multilayered (stratified)</b> or it can be <b>pseudostratified.</b>

        </p>
        <div class="">
            <b>Pseudostratified columnar epithelia:</b>In true sense this is a simple epithelium as each cell rests on the basement membrane. This  epithelium gives an appearance of a multilayered epithelium due to unequal height and shape of the cells.
        </div>
        <div class="">
                <b>Unilayered (simple) epithelia:</b> Single layer of cells resting on a basement membrane.It may be further classified according to the shape of the cells constituting them.

                    <li>
                        When the cells are flattened, their height being very little as compared to their width. Such an epithelium is called <b>squamous simple epithelium</b>

                            <ul>

                                    Squamous epithelium lines the alveoli of the lungs.

                                    Squamous epithelium is also found lining some parts of the renakl tubules, and in some parts of the internal ear.
                                </li>

                        When the height and width of the cells of the epithelium are more or less equal (i.e. they look like squares in section) it is described as a <b>cuboidal epithelium.</b>

                        In some some situations,the cell surface bears cilla.This is cilliated columnar epithelium.

                                    Some columnar cells have a secretory function. The apical parts of their cytoplasm contain secretory vacuoles. Secretory columnar cells are scattered in the mucosa of the stomach and intestines.

                                    In the respiratory tract the cilia move mucous accumulating in the bronchi (and containing trapped dust particles) toward the larynx and pharynx. When exces- sive this mucous is brought out as sputum during coughing.
