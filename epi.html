        <p>
            An epithelium may consist of only one layer of cells when it is called a <b>Unilayered or simple</b> epithelium.Alternatively, it may be <b>multilayered (stratified)</b> or it can be <b>pseudostratified.</b>

        </p>
        <div class="">
            <b>Pseudostratified columnar epithelia:</b>In true sense this is a simple epithelium as each cell rests on the basement membrane. This  epithelium gives an appearance of a multilayered epithelium due to unequal height and shape of the cells.
        </div>
        <div class="">
                <b>Unilayered (simple) epithelia:</b> Single layer of cells resting on a basement membrane.It may be further classified according to the shape of the cells constituting them.

                        When the cells are flattened, their height being very little as compared to their width. Such an epithelium is called <b>squamous simple epithelium</b>
