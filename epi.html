            An epithelium may consist of only one layer of cells when it is called a <b>Unilayered or simple</b> epithelium.Alternatively, it may be <b>multilayered (stratified)</b> or it can be <b>pseudostratified.</b>

            <p><b>Pseudostratified columnar epithelia:</b>In true sense this is a simple epithelium as each cell rests on the basement membrane.
