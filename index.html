    <p>
        <h2>Tissues:</h2>
        <p>Tissue is an assembly of similar cells that together carry out a specific function.The 
        English word "tissue" derives from the French word "tissu",the past participle of the verb 
        tisser, "to weave".</p>

            The study of tissues is known as histology.
            Xavier Bichat introduced the word tissue into the study of anatomy by 1801. He was <q>"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves"</q>.Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed, a number later reduced by other authors.

                    Animal tissue consists of cells that are similar in structure and function, organized to perform particular activities that contribute to the overall functioning of the organism. Tissues enable collaboration among cells for more complex functions, forming organs and systems that support life.

                                Epithelial tissues are found in the outer layer of cell walls of epithelial cells, such as skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessels. They provide support, protection, and communication between cells. Examples include keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.
                                Epithelial tissues act as barriers against pathogens and physical injuries.

Conclusion
Animal tissue is a collection of similar cells that work together to perform specific functions within an organism. There are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. Each type plays a unique role in maintaining the complexity and functionality of animal bodies.

1. Epithelial Tissue
Epithelial tissue lines the surfaces of organs and structures, serving various functions including protection, absorption, and secretion. It can be classified based on cell shape (squamous, cuboidal, columnar) and the number of cell layers (simple or stratified).

2. Connective Tissue
Connective tissues provide structural support and connect other tissues and organs. They consist of a matrix that includes living cells and a non-living substance. Primary cells within connective tissues include fibroblasts, and they can vary greatly in structure and function, including bone, blood, and cartilage.
