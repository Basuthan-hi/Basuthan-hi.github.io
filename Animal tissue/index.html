        <p>Tissue is an assembly of similar cells that together carry out a specific function.The 
        English word "tissue" derives from the French word "tissu",the past participle of the verb 
        tisser, "to weave".</p>

        The study of tissues is known as histology.
            Xavier Bichat introduced the word tissue into the study of anatomy by 1801. He was the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves.Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed, a number later reduced by other authors.
