            <h2>History</h2>
            Xavier Bichat introduced the word tissue into the study of anatomy by 1801.He was "the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves".

            <h2>Epithelial Tissues</h2>
            It Covers and protects body surfaces, and Involved in nutrient absorption and hormone secretion.

            <h2>Connective Tissues</h2>
            They help maintain body shape and structure, and provide support to muscles and nerves.
        </a>
        <div class="mus">
            <h2>Muscle Tissues</h2>
            They provide force and movement, and they are involved in muscle contraction and relaxation.
        </div>
        <div class="ner">
            <h2>Nervous Tissues</h2>
            Contains neurons for transmitting impulses and neuroglia for support.
            Found in the brain, spinal cord <span class="title">(CNS)<div class="des"> <b>CNS</b>: Central Nervous System</div></span>, and nerves <span class="title">(PNS)<div class="des"><b>PNS</b>:Peripheral Nervous System</div></span>
