        <p>Tissue is an assembly of similar cells that together carry out a specific function.The 
        English word "tissue" derives from the French word "tissu",the past participle of the verb 
        tisser, "to weave".</p>

        The study of tissues is known as histology.
            Xavier Bichat introduced the word tissue into the study of anatomy by 1801. He was the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves.Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed, a number later reduced by other authors.

                <p>Connective tissues have been regarded as a supporting tissue because they connect and keep together many organs of the body, they provide mechanical support to different parts of the body and to the whole body as well, and protect and isolate many organs.</p>
