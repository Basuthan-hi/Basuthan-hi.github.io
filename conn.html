                    <b>Loose connective tissues</b> are present all over the body, where support and elasticity both are needed. Blood vessels, nerves and muscles, all have a loose connective tissue wrapping. They form the subcutaneous layer under the skin along with adipose tissues, attaching muscles and other structures to the skin.</p>

                        <p><b>Areolar Tissue:</b> It is present under the skin and supports epithelium. It contains randomly distributed fibres, fibroblasts, mast cells and macrophages. It supports the organs present in the abdominal cavity, fills the space between muscle fibres and wraps around blood and lymph vessels.</p>

                                <p>Areolar tissue plays a crucial role in the body by providing support and flexibility to various structures. 
                                Additionally, areolar tissue contains immune cells that help defend against pathogens, contributing to the bodyâ€™s overall immune response. Its ability to act as a fluid reservoir helps maintain tissue hydration and electrolyte balance, making it an essential component in maintaining healthy tissue function.

Around internal organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and intestines, adipose tissue forms visceral fat, which cushions and protects these vital structures. Additionally, it is present in bone marrow as yellow bone marrow, between muscles as intermuscular fat, and within breast tissue. </p></div>

                                <p>Adipose tissue, commonly known as fat tissue, serves several vital functions in the body:
<br>
<b>Energy Storage:</b> It stores energy in the form of lipids, which can be used by the body when needed. <br>
<b>Insulation</b>: It helps to insulate the body, maintaining body temperature by providing a layer of thermal insulation. <br>
<b>Cushioning and Protection</b>: It cushions and protects internal organs, reducing the risk of injury. <br>
<b>Hormone Production</b>: It produces hormones such as leptin, which regulates appetite and metabolism. <br>
<b>Support</b>: It provides structural support to organs and tissues, helping to maintain their shape and position. <br>

                    In the <b>dense connective tissue</b>, fibroblast cells and fibres are compactly packed. Their main function is to support and transmit mechanical forces. They are somewhat less flexible than loose connective tissue. On the basis of the arrangement of collagen fibres, they are divided into two types</p>

                       <p> <b>Dense regular tissue:</b> In the dense regular connective tissue, the orientation of fibres are regular. The collagen fibres are present between the parallel running bundles of fibres. The regular arrangement enhances tensile strength and poses resistance to stretching in the direction of the orientation of fibre. Examples of dense regular tissue are tendons and ligaments.</p>
